# Changelog

## 2020-12-25 v0.1.1
### Bug fixes:
1. Save images as files to `media` directory, instead of base64 strings in the note to enable lazy loading of images in notes.
2. Hide embeds during zooming, due to zooming/animations getting laggy with heavy multimedia content.
3. Check marks positions in colour selections.
4. Check default color in colour selections.
5. Ignore `.gitignore` files.
